Prisma was used to accelerate the development time. 

Docker is needed to run the database and also the prisma endpoint

Steps to run locally

cd into newSocialGraphProblem
RUN npm i .             #to install depencencies
RUN docker-compose up -d    #to spin up the mysql and the prisma endpoint server
RUN prisma deploy        #to deploy the prisma endpoint      
RUN node src/index.js    #to run custom endpoints  


The GraphQL Endpoint will start running on http://localhost:4466/
The custom endpoint will be listening on http://localhost:4000
