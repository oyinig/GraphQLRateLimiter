Prisma was used to accelerate the development time. 

Docker is needed to run the database and also the prisma endpoint

Steps to run locally

cd into newSocialGraphProblem2/
RUN npm i .
RUN docker-compose up -d
RUN prisma deploy
RUN node src/index.js


The GraphQL Endpoint will start running on http://localhost:4000/

Only One Endpoint has rate limiting implemented on it since it's just to express the concept of how it could be done
The endpoint is getUserByEmailThrottled

To Test, create a user using the mutaton createCustomUsers for example:

mutation{
  
  createCustomUsers(
		name: "Oyinlola Israel!"
		age: 29
		email: "o@i.com"
  ){
    id
    name
    age
  }
    
  
}



With the email that was created above, clicking on a endpoint that has rate limiting on it
# Write your query or mutation here
# Write your query or mutation here
{
  getUserByEmailThrottled(
    reqEmail:"o@i.com"
  )
  { 
    email
    id
    name
    
  }

}


The console logs, and the response header will be showing the neccessary information

Thank you.
